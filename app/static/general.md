_Take notes without pen and paper - use only bits_

## Basic idea
**BitBoard** is (for now) just another web app for taking notes, but in the future it might turn into something more.

For now, it allows organizing notes into nested categories, and formatting them using Markdown, but soon it could
support multiple note types, inter-note links, suggested meta-information, smart search, visualization and a lot more.

## Source code
The source code of the whole app is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/zjurelinac/Bitboard).
